She couldn't help but sting my finger,clinging a moment before I flung herto the ground. Her gold is true, not the trickevening light plays on my roses.She curls into herself, stinger twitching,gilt wings folded. Her whole life just a few weeks,and my pain subsided in a moment.In the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.No warning from either of us:she sleeping in the richness of those petals,then the hand, my hand, cupping the bloomin devastating force, crushing the petals for the scent.And she mortally threatened, wholly unawarethat I do this daily, alone with the gold last light,in what seems to me an act of love.I will not speak ill of Jack Flick.I will rarely lookat the scar he made on my cheekone summer at the lake.I won't speak ill of Jack whose frecklesand gangly legs are gone.So is the drained face I saw when he sawwhat he'd done with a sharp rocknonchalantly skipped.I will speak well, for it was somewhatsweet to lie on the dock while Jackand his friends bent downand wiped my face with a sandy towel.I will speak well of them,for most are goneand the wound proved small.I will speak well, for the rockmissed my eye. I can hardly findthe scar. Jack went into the aircorps, fought in one of the wars,retired, and lived less than a yearbefore his tender heart gave out.I will speak well of Jack.How quiet is the spruce,the wind twillsthrough the uppermost tierof splayed leaves.Now the song of a birdlike the squeaky lockover a canoe's oar,followed by startling chirps,the sky pushing its cloudslike sailboats,and I think, what kind of Godkeeps himself secretso that to find him outwe have to seek, as children dofor something like the beetlescuttling between grass,hidden in plain sight.You think we are the pointed argument,the man drunk at the party showing offhis gun collection, the bed of nettles.What we really are is hidden from you:girl weeping in the closet among her stepfather's boots;tuft of rabbit fur caught in barbed wire; body of the babyin the landfill; boy with the shy mouth playing his guitarat the picnic table, out in the dirt yard.We slide into this world benign and pliable,quills pressed down smooth over back and tail.Only one hour here stiffens the barbs into thousandsof quick retorts. Everything this well-guardedremembers being soft once.I planted an apple tree in memoryof my mother, who is not gone,but whose memory has becomeso transparent that she remembersslicing apples with her grandmother(yellow apples; blue bowl) better thanthe fruit that I hand her today. Still,she polishes the surface with her thumb,holds it to the light and says with nohesitation, Oh, Yellow Transparent . . . they're so fragile, you can almost seeto the core. She no longer remembers howto roll the crust, sweeten the sauce, buther desire is clear—it is pie that she wants.And so, I slice as close as I dare to the core—to that little cathedral to memory—wherethe seeds remember everything they needto know to become yellow and transparent.The entrance at the back of the complexled onto a road, where an upended couchtilted into a ditch and a washing machinegleamed avocado beneath pine needles.From the end, you turned left and left again,then cut a trail to find the cul-de-sacof bright brick houses. We'd walk as faras we dared before a man pushing a mowermight stop to ask, "whadda you boys need?"That was a question we could never answer.I loved the name of the place, White Hall,imagined that each interior was a stretchof marble perfect wall adorned by smilingphotos of the family. Our own hallswere brailled with nail holes of formertenants, the spackled rounds of fists.But doesn't longing clarify the body?The boys I left behind: Tommy, wearingthe World War II trenching tool;Danny, whose father, so much olderthan the other parents, died in his reclinerone sunny afternoon while watching baseball;Duke, who stole his mother's car and crashedinto a wall. Boys who knew when you were posing,waiting for someone to say, "smile." Boyswho, on those latch-key days, held themselvesin narrow passages when no onewas there to show them what to do. my father’s body is a mapa record of his journeyhe carries a bulletlodged in his left thighthere is a hollow where it entereda protruding bump where it sleepsthe doctors say it will never awakenit is the one souvenir he insists on keepingmother has her own opinionsbố cùa con điên—your father is crazyas a childi wanted a scar just like my father’sbold and appalling     a mushroom explosionthat said i too was at warinstead i settled for a grain of ricea scar so small look closely therehere between the eyesa bit to the rightthere on the bridge of my nosefather says i was too young to rememberit happened while i was sleepingleaking roof the pounding raindrop after drop after dropit has long been forgotten this practice of the motherweaning a child she crushes the seeds of a greenchili rubs it to her nipple what the child feelsshe too will   share in this act   of lovemy own mother says it was not meantto be cruel when cruelty she tells meis a child’s lips   torn from breast as proofback home the women wear teeth marksWhy are you still seventeenand drifting like a dog after dark,dragging a shadow you’ve found?Put it back where it belongs,and that bend of river, too. That’s not the roadyou want, though you have it to yourself.Gone are the cars that crawl to townfrom the reactors, a parade of insects, metallic,fuming along the one four-lane street.The poplars of the shelterbelt lean awayfrom the bypass that never had much to pass bybut coyote and rabbitbrush.Pinpricks stabbed in a map too dark to read—I stared at stars light-years away.Listen. That hissing? Just a sprinklerdamping down yesterday until it’s today.The cottonwoods shiver, or I do,every leaf rustling as if it’s the one about to tear itself, not I.Memory takes the graveyard shift.Yes, your childhood now a legend of fountainsYes, your childhood, now a legendgone to weeds, still remembers the gray roadthat set out to cross the desert of the future.And how, always just ahead,gray water glittered, happy to be just a mirage.Who steps off the gray bus at the depot?Sidewalks shudder all the way home.Blinds close their scratchy eyes.Who settles in your old room?Sniffy air sprawls as if it owns the place,and now your teenage secrets have no one to tell.For the spider laying claim to the corner,there is a stickiness to spin, that the living may begto be wrapped in silk and devoured,leaving not even the flinch from memory.I got a call from the White House, from thePresident himself, asking me if I’d do him a personalfavor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.President, anything you like.” He said, “Just actlike nothing’s going on. Act normal. That wouldmean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,sure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’show I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’mtortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I wasdying to tell someone that the President himself calledme, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure toact normal was killing me. And what was going onanyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. Isaw the President on TV yesterday. He was shakinghands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really afarmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenlyI was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.I looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked morelike I was trying to be normal. That’s prettysuspicious. I opened the door and looked around.What was going on? There was a car parked in frontof my car that I had never seen before, a car thatwas trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwisepeople will think something’s going on. I got intomy car and sped down the road. I could feel thoselittle radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,but, apparently, they were under orders not to stopme. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’sgoing on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.I hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Justgetting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t knowyou had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.You’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes Irefer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a privatejoke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” sheasked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promiseyou. Everything is normal. The President shookhands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that sucha big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “andthat man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, Iknow,” I said, feeling better.Of course wars, of course lice, of course limbs on opposing sidesto remind a body about ambivalence, of course orphans and empty beds and eyesexiled for blinking in the harsh light. Of course Khrushchev gave Crimeato the Ukraine in a blind drunk, and yes, land mines and burning skinand of course organs, some members dismemberedto shake at strangers and their evil, and there is no wayto imagine that a man shaking a dried penis would ever utter the word darling.Of course personal, add starch for pain, add bluing, of course hangthe laundry in the basement, there are thieves in the backyard, of coursedeparting trains, carload after carload of sorrow,the man on top of a boxcar waving,his rifle silhouetted against the white sky, its color drainingthe way warmth left the Bosnian after he’d burned the last page of the last book,knowing he had reached the end of something though it was not end enough.Of course kisses, the stages of kissing like running borders,endless conversations, stations of the cross, till even the promise of kissing bores you,of course teeth gnashing, ethnic cleansing. The cynical will shrug off the past,the future, the whole left hip of Ecuador slashed for six days of oil,of course an X on the coats of the sick so they would stand apartfor deportation, of course rogue tumors over the body politic,the same bodies that took Egyptian mummies and powdered themto use as food seasoning, bon vivant cannibalism,and yes civilized men tossed living penguins into furnaces to fuel their ships.Of course partitions so that after the new territories were defined,families had to line up on a cliff with bullhornsto talk to their people on the other side,of course courage, at times a weapon against yearning, surrender another,a mother of course goes on setting the table, even if it’s with broken plates,and a friend will say gently of course I want to ride with you to the funeral,of course of course of course of course,now then, negotiations, whatever,palisades, the end of whimsy,but then one evening though it is wartime,a man climbs the hill to an amphitheater to play his cello at twilightand history stops talking for a moment and sighswhile the melancholy of Albinonipasses from heart to heart and each lifts a little,the way passing a baby around a room can be sacramental,and the memories of simple pleasures become more beautiful, the memoryof your joy on a highway to see in the next lane in a neighboring cara clown take off his nose at the end of the day, the memoryof how your mother laid roses, sweetheart roses, on the cold grate of the fireplace,and the sudden rain one afternoon in fall after you’d hiked far into the dellsand you huddled deep in your overcoat in the wet,waiting out the storm with a sheepthat had come up to lean against your sidelike a rock.If they ask what it was like, say it was like the searolling barrels of itself at you in the shadowless light of the shore,say it was like a spider, black as night, large as a campesino’s hand,a deepness that could balance a small world of dirt as easily as a giftof gleaming red tomatoes held out to you eight at a time.If they ask you how it felt, say solitary,at first the ease of sleeping alone, warm without even a sheet,then the nonchalance of a dirt road leading down the hill, its dustraised and re-raised in plumes as each guest departed,and later, say it was like the blind cat that came out of nowhereto lie on your tile floor, lifting its face to stare with white marble eyes.If they ask what you heard, tell them the single note of the watchman,who coughed his one syllable when you went to bed,and at the end of every dream when you woke with a simple plea—stay, go—again, the cough of the watchman.If they ask about thirst, tell them no one could carry water as faras it had to go, so that when it was time to rest,people went to the spigot at the edge of the train tracksand cupped their hands under the water, lowering their faces to drink.Tell them a man could stand at noon in the park wearing nothing but underwearand beg for hours with his cup empty.Tell them you could sit quietly while phrases you didn't know you knewrose up in the language there and on an undisturbed lake in your mindyou could back float—that weightless prayer that praysLet me die with my toes pointing up at the sun.When they ask what people will eventually get around to asking,How was the food? Tell them batata, mamón, guanábana, maní,indigenous crops exchanging places with hunger,giving up to the dark store window whose inventory is one handof bananas sold one banana at a time, giving up to little pyramids of limesby the side of the road and the kids who tend them, dreamingof a few coins tossed down in the dirt.The prisoner can’t go any longer, but he does.The beggar can’t go on begging, but watch—Tomorrow he’ll be in the alley, holding out a bowlTo everyone, to even a young, possibly poorer, child.The mother can’t go on believing,But she will kneel for hours in the cathedral,Holding silence in her arms.The rain goes on, daily, sometimes, and we cry,As often as not alone.The fishmonger, the bell ringer, the cook, eachCan be corrupted in a less than dire way.Nothing can replace the sea breezes you were born to.Nothing can stay the shy ache in the palmyou hold out to the fortune-teller.The concrete lions on her steps go onMaking bloodless journeys, they go onHunting in air longer than any of you will live to watch,Hunting still after your futures become all irisesand blamelessness.What’s most human must drivean arrow to the heart.Ghosts, too, must abide by this directive& remain transparent,going about their business in old houses.Before I was an I, I longed to be ethereal.Sprouting wings at will & gliding throughcul-de-sacs and malls around the valley.My hands, too, would gradually disappearfollowed by my arms, then neck & headuntil my whole body was slight as allergen.Before I was an I, I spoke an old languagethat would return on drowsy afternoons.Therefore I struggled to saythe simplest sentences. So much sothat the maligned semicolonbecame an ardent ally, an islandof pause and the deep breath.The comma, too, bless its tiny soul,was the crumb which the godof small favors multipliedtenfold for my morning pie.Before I was an I, knowledgeclung to me like burrs & hungerguided my ship like the barefoot light    on the sleeping land & sea.The fearless blackbirds see me againat the footpath beside the tall grassessprouting like unruly morning hair.They caw and caw like vulgar boyson street corners making love to girlswith their “hey mamathis” and their “hey mama that.”But this gang of birds is much too slick.They are my homeys of the airwith their mousse-backed hair and Crayolablack coats like small fry hoods who smokeand joke about each other’s mothers,virginal sisters, and the sweet arc of revenge.These birds spurn my uneaten celery sticks,feckless gestures, ineffective hosannas.They tag one another, shrill and terrible,caroling each to each my weekly wages.But they let me pass, then flit away.They won’t mess with me this time—they know where I live.But these, thy lovers are not dead.…They will rise up and hear your voice. . .. and run to kiss your mouth.In the garden of Père Lachaise,city of the dead, we passed angelscovering their faces in shame,& nineteenth-century trees, with tops bowedas if their only purpose was to grieve,& crossed the Transversales to Wilde’s grave.When lovers leave, they leave their kissesglistening on the gray slab,on impressions of lips themselves,a tissue of strangers’ cellsthe conservators cannot leave alone,& scrub the graffiti, as the plaque decreesby law, no one can deface this tomb,& still the images of lips remain,dark gray stains of animal fatimprisoned in limestone.Lips are pressed as high as loversclimb, against the Sphinx’s ridiculousheaddress, on the carved trumpetof fame, & on the cheeks of its voracious faceof mindless passion flying with eyes pinched tight,that some farsighted lover tried to openwith lines from a red pen, like a blepharoplasty,while others kissed its sybaritic mouthto make a poem a prophecy.So here is love alivesurviving the wreckage it survives,a lipstick envelope of hearts on their flightto some other place, less aware,more receiving, a final Champ de Grâce.This is the poem of death.There is only oneand no other.Every one is an occasion,one way or another,and the last poem is this poem of death.It is an occasion like no other.I will no longer lope after elegance,beauty’s body, or love’s wonder.I will be sorry for everythingI was, and for everything I was not.I speak to you as if you were my brother.I will forgive everyone.Death will make this possible.There will be no other.Death was in the mindbefore thought or love,in ourselves, and in our lovers.The poem of death is speechless.A companion will appear againlike another self, like your brother.Enough now, enough has been said.The spinning leaf will spinlike no other.Nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel,or what life itself eventually reveals.No more studies of kindness or courtesy,nor grace or charity, all is needless now.All is needless now, sky, world, familygrieving for their bundles of purity,now beyond disgrace, failure, winter streets,or whatever attacks, and then retreats.Classrooms emptied of children’s things,paper and paste, and love’s imaginings,bundles of peace, Christmas-blessedwith the unborn and the dead at rest,nothing can reach you now, not lead or steelor what life itself eventually reveals.Among physicians rich in their death watchIn hallways crowded with locked wheelchairs,Cradles of a century’s platitudes,The stale air smelling of disinfectantAnd weeping wounds enough to stupefy nurses,Among the staring insomniacs of the day room,The stroke victims on their rented gurneys,Complaining orderlies and rattling cartsAmong these in this place my father layAt the end of everythingIn the curved landscapes of white sheetsAbandoned finally by parents, his son,The loyal company, old friends, his deathA sign of other deaths too soon to comeUnable to recall one life, his thoughts,Features, he lay unknown to himself,The tall hunter of pheasants out with his boyIn vellum corn and brassy orchardsIn an autumn that never was, the proudWhite-collared Ford employee lay on a bedToo short for legs tattooed with red burn-ringsFrom daily syringes of CytosarConsidered useless, still a requirementFor state funding for a body describedLeukemic waiting for Saturday's fiddlersWho came to raise the spirits of the deadWith a music he never cared for turnedSuddenly attractive, he found genius,Theirs or his like some lyrical phosphorThat shapes itself in the dry night airTo make a thing then make it disappearHe lay listening to the county fiddlersAt the end of every purpose, act and formI leave you here, my father, in perfect accord.Imagine half your facerubbed out yetyou are suited upand walkingto the office.How will your matesgreet you?with heavy hearts,flowers,rosary beads?How shall we greetthe orphan boy,the husband whose handslipped, childrenand wife swept away?How to greetour new yearsand our birthdays?Shall we alwayslight a candle?Do we rememberthat time erasesthe shore, grassgrows, pain’smodified?At Hikkaduwain 1980 I wrote a ditty,a sailor’s songabout rainin sunny Ceylon.I don’t knowwhat Calypsonianswould composeabout this

Is it nowconsidered obscene?Yet tomorrowwe must go to the oceanand refresh ourselvesin the sea breezedown in Hikkaduwawhere it is rainingin sunny Ceylon.Tomorrow, we mustrenew our vowsat sunrise, at sunset.Let us say the next timethe ocean recedesand parrots gawkand flee, and restlessdogs insist their humanswake up, we will not peerat the revelationof the ocean bed,nor seek photographs.We will run to higher ground,and gathered therewith our children,our cats, dogs,pigs, with what we’vecarried in our hands—albums, letters—we will make a circle,kneel, sit,stand in no particulardirection, prayand be silent,open our lungsand shout thanksto our godsthanks to our dogs.Jesus did not ride that monstrous wave,not Yahweh, Jah, Allah, none of the majorGods or the minor ones, not even the godlessstrode that bugger which sliced our livesin two: the past where we danced ballroomwhile the children played carom, and mangosstained our lapels, and today, hobbling,scavenging in ash heaps, how easythe arithmetic, day and night, two by two.Bring on the mind workers.Let a thousand doctors bloom.I lived right here on the x, my nameis blue: sea green blue blue greenI do not speak in tongues.

Contamination. Toxic breath.Each air-raid drill is sheer terror,but some of the city kids giggle.They don't believe that deathis real.They've never touched a bullet,or seen a vulture, or made musicby shakingthe jawboneof a mule.When I hide under my frail school desk,my heart grows as rough and brittleas the slab of woodthat fails to protect mefrom reality'sgloom.I have come to realize the body is its own pyre, that degreerises from within, the fatty acids a kind of kindling.Like a scientist in a lab, this much I have established, blood jelledlike gasoline, the years spread before me like a mappinned with targets, where I’m raging even now.It works both ways. Clear the forests to see your enemiesand your enemies see you clearly. Like all effective incendiaries,I won’t only bloom where I’m planted.Tonight we will function like women.The snow has gone away, the ice with its amniotic glare.I clasp my sister’s tiny hand.We will not turn awayThough spring, spring with its black appetite,Comes seeping out of the earth.The lion was sad. He suffered usTo touch him. When I placed the bread of my handsIn his mammalian heat, I was remindedThat the world outside this worldIs all vinegar and gall, that to be a young girl at the foot of a godRequires patience. Timing.The White Witch has mustered her partisans.Because I am fascinated by her bracelets strung with baby teeth,I will remember her as the womanWho grins with her wrists. From my thicket of heatherI note that in her own congenital wayShe is pure, that tonight she ushers something new into the world.I cannot stop it. I cannot stop it just as in that other placeI could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming.Though in this closed realm the smell of camphor is overwhelmingI have nothing but my hands to useIn ministering to the dead. Here tooMy hands must suffice.Hush now while I testify. They are shaving him.The corona of his mane falls awayLike pieces of money. In the moon’s milk lightHer bangled wrists grin as she raises the blade.Something is diffused. In whatever world he comes againThere will be women like us who choose to.Somebody says draw a map. Populate it with the incidentsof your childhood. Mark the spot where the lake recededafter a winter of light snow. The stairs on which someoneslapped you. The place where the family dog hung itselfby jumping over the back fence while still on the dog run,hours later its body like a limp flag on a windless day.Draw a map, someone says. Let yourself remember.In the refugee camp a hundred thousand strongdraw the stony outcrop from which you could no longer seethe plume of smoke that was your village. Draw a squarefor the bathroom stall where Grandpa hid each dayin order to eat his one egg free from the starving eyesof his classmates, an X for the courthouse where you and hewere naturalized, a broken line for the journey. Draw a map,Jon says. Let it be your way into the poem. Here is wherethat plane filled with babies crashed that I was not on.Here is where I was ashamed. On the second floorat Pranash University the people wait their turn. Have youdrawn your map, Jon asks. He has rolled up his sleeves.Forty-five minutes to noon the Prince stands up and saysthat the monks must be excused. We watch them file out,saffron robes as if their bodies have burst into blossom.Draw a map. Fly halfway around the globe. Here is the roomnext to the library where you realize how poor your tradition is,the local people with poetic forms still in use that date backto the time of Christ. Tell us about your map. Explainhow these wavy lines represent the river, this rectanglethe school-turned-prison where only sevenescaped with their lives. This is my map. This star the placewhere I sat in a roomful of people among whom not onewas not touched by genocide. Every last map resplendent with deaththough nobody knows where their loved ones lie buried.How many times can I appropriate a story that is not mine to tell?The woman stands up and says she is not a poet, that shedoesn’t have the words. She points to a triangle on a piece of paper.Here is the spot where she found human bones in the wellof her childhood home, and how her mother told herdon’t be afraid because it was not the work of wild animals.Listen closely as I sing this. The man standing at the gatetottering on his remaining limb is a kind of metronome, his oneleg planted firmly on the earth. Yes, I have made him beautifulbecause I aim to lay all my cards on the table. In the book reviewthe critic writes, “Barry seeks not to judge but to understand.”Did she want us to let her be, or does she wantto be there walking the grounds of the old prison on the hillof the poison tree where comparatively a paltry twenty thousanddied? In the first room with the blown upblack-and-white of a human body gone abstract someone hasto turn and face the wall not because of the human painrepresented in the photo but because of her calmness,the tranquility with which she tells us that her fatherand her sister and her brother were killed. In graduate schoola whole workshop devoted to an image of a woman with bleachthrown in the face and the question of whether or notthe author could write, “The full moon sat in the windowlike a calcified eye, the woman’s face aglow with a knowingness.”I felt it come over me and I couldn’t stop. I tried to pull myselftogether and I couldn’t. They were children. An army of childsoldiers. In the room papered with photos of the Khmer Rougepicture after picture of teenagers, children whose parentswere killed so that they would be left alone in the worldto do the grisly work that precedes paradise.And the photos of the victims, the woman holding her newbornin her arms as her head is positioned in a vise, in this casethe vise an instrument not of torturebut of documentation, the head held still as the camera capturesthe image, the thing linking all their faces, the abject fearand total hopelessness as existsin only a handful of places in the history of the visible world.For three $US per person she will guide you through what wasTuol Sleng prison, hill of the strychnine tree.Without any affectation she will tell you the story of howher father and her sister and her brother went amongthe two million dead. There are seventy-four formsof poetry in this country and each one is still meant to be sung.Say, when we woke those icy spring mornings they were still there.The upper portion of their faces long ruined but you could still seethe meaning in their hands,palms once covered in gold. We knew better than to call themby their names, Light that Shines Throughout the Universeand His consort, but there were storiesof  travelers lost  in the foothills of  the Hindu  Kush and a distantbrilliance that led them home. The way a candle physically entersyour body after it has beensnuffed out. The pearly smoke suffused in the air. In one schoolhundreds  of  miles  away  all  the   girls  my age  were  poisoned,and last week outside the capitala woman like my  sister was shot dead  in front of a crowd by two menwho forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidelso they could kill herand be done with it.  After the  visitors were blasted I had a dream.I saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at himdirectly. His imageon the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world.In   my   dream  the  man   said,  “Thousands   of  lifetimes  agowhen my body was cutinto pieces by an evil king, I was not caught up in the idea of the self.”Then  in  my   dream  someone   picked  up  a rock  and  I  woke  up.It took almost a month,the  great  heads  drilled with holes,  then anti-aircraft  tanks rolled in.Each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us,like a person. Before it happenedwe talked about it. Grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven?Second Aunt said it was more realistic this way. God not in heavenbut in exile.The   first    great    poet  ofthe  crisis  the   one  whosegeneration   was  left  as  iffirebombed     though      ifyou    look     back   at    theseminal    work    you   willsee  that only a  handful ofof   the   poems    explicitlytouch   on   that  dark timethe    blood    filling     withvirulence    and   the  nightalways          black         andspangled   with  stars  sayswhen           faced         with difficult      material      thepoet       should          beginobliquely      creeping     infrom   the   edge  a  squareof         light             movingimperceptibly   across  thefloor as    the earth    turns and   so   I   will   tell    youthat  ever  since  I saw  thefootage           of              thejournalists   hiding  in  theattic      the    rope    ladderpulled     up     after    themonly     the       one       with foreign   papers    left     tostand   her   ground  downbelow   the   journalist    atfirst     calmly    sitting   onthe      couch      but     thenhuddling  in  a   cabinet  asthe     soldiers    enter    the apartment     next       door,the   cries   of   the  motherfloating       through       thewall       ib’ni       ib’ni     thelanguage     ancient       likesomething       whetted   onstone     the   way   I   image language      would        havesounded     in     the  brokenmouth    of     King      DavidAbsalom        Absalom    theman-child       hanging     bythe    shining    black   nooseof     his     own    hair  in the fragrant         woods           ofEphraim       ib’ni           ib’ninext    door    the   sound  ofa    body      being     draggedfrom     the    apartment    ashis            mother           wailsinto      the        dark        how many     mothers   and   howmany     sons    dragged   outinto    a       night     spangledwith             stars          whereeverything    is  a   metaphorfor      virulence      my     son my   son   and   ever  since  I saw    a   clip  of the   footagethe       foreign        journalistmanaged   to    smuggle   outof   the  country   images   ofthe        journalist       herselfhiding   in   a   space   meantfor   buckets   and   rags    as next     door    the     soldiersdrag    away   a   young   boyplease     hear     it   again   achild    of    no    more   thantwelve         his        mother’slamentations             foreverseared   in    the    blood   of this    thing   I   call  my  lifebut     really     what     is    itwhat   is   this  light  I   holdso   dear  it  wants   to moveimperceptibly    across   thefloor    as   the   earth   turnsso     as   not     to      become too       aware      of      itself?Nowhere    in   the     Halakha’s     five   thousand   years   of   rulesdoes   it     specifically    state    Thou     shall     notbut     sometimes    tradition    carries    more     weight    than    lawand   so   for    much   of   the    past    year   we    have   not    talkedabout     what    will    happen    on     Thursday,    how   the    cervixwill     start     its     slow    yawn,     the     pelvic      floor     strainingas         the           head        crowns,      the      fontanelles     allowingthe       bony        panes       of       the      skull     to      pass    throughuntil,     over    the   next    24   months,    the   five   cranial   platesgradually      ossify,     the      head      forming    its     own    helmetas     structures     harden    over   the    soft    meats   of  the  brain,nor     do   we    talk   about    the   colostrum  sunny  as egg   yolksnow   collecting  in   your   breasts,   the    thing’s   first   nutrientsalready    ready    and    waiting,    the     event    just    days   awayand   still  we  do  not  talk  about it, the mass growing inside youtucked    up    safe     in   the     leeward   side    under    the   heartbecause   sometimes   our   god   is   a  jealous god,   the evil   eyelidless    and    all-seeing.  Instead  we  will wait  until  it is  done,until  the  creature  has been  cleaned and wrapped in soft cloth,the    bloody     cord   that    binds    you    severed.    And   maybeyou       will      name      it      Dolores,      which       means     grief, or perhaps you will call it Mara, the Hebrew name for bitternessbecause       this      is      how     we      protect     what     we    love,by   hiding   what  it   truly  means  to   us,  the little  bag  of  goldwe    keep   buried   in  the  yard,   the  thing  we will do anythingto      keep      safe,      even    going     so      far    as    to     pretendit    doesn’t    exist,   that   there’s   nothing  massing in  the  darkdespite  the steady  light  emanating  from  your  face, a radianceso bright sometimes I can’t look at you, the joy so  overpoweringyou     want    to     shout   it     from   the    highest    mountaintopstraight into God’s ear.One day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the delicatenessneedless, consumable.How everything here naturally passes into night, a roomw/o walls.Could mindlessness keep us alive? Could bright colors?Tonight I am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her fatherbeing shot in the head. Imagine needing to believe the one you lovehas been destroyed.Now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. Here alone on deckcould I make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent rising, the gaspingfor air?I have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness—  but I too am such things.What does it mean to be eroded? What would be the significance of slipping one legover the rail & straddling the indifference?Yes. Once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of Kobé, Japan.All night the waves. All night the somnambulistic urges.Or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged & torn,but underneaththe roots of the water lilies like ladderstrailing down into the marvelous.Shagged-gold, at rest the great haunchesas if axled, fur sleeked like a butter rug.In the Serengeti sun, the male’s haremlike a solar system, each lady keptexclusive, her seasonal heat for him alone,estrous belly pressed to the ground,then the male’s riding her musculature—throughout evolution the cat’s barbed penisnicking his breached mate as he dismounts.See the deliberate walk, cool as a criminal,the multi-jointed forepaws placed consciouslyeven by the usurped king, his eye teeth blacked,his tail rotted off, tired wag of a bloody stumpas he finally falls dying, the crucified face beddedin its wheel of hair, the tawny miscegenated eyesbinocular in breadth. Shark in the long grasses.Shark in the long grass. Smell everywhere, the gazellewith its small-headed splendor gracing the plainsis ambushed, devoured, its horned bone racksouvenired, the murderer’s ripping muzzle crimsoned.In the despot’s sons’ palace of pure goldthe three in the iron cage lazing like statues.When the American unlocks the hinged doorour shackled hearts contract. Unhooded and nakedwe are pushed into their presence,and for a shining moment the animals study us,these fabulous aliens.Here in a desert captivitysnatched from the baobab’s sour fruit,their swagged bellies shifted, broken, and resignedlythe ancient drive rose up only in one—its head wreathed beyond sorrowas it slouched out of the habitual darkness,the permanent rictus of its terrible mouthpain-struck. The thing came toward mewith its ruined light, and I saw affliction in it.Dream of mastery. Dream of being wholly consumed,freed. I am the lion and the lion is me.Then the American pulls us out.Literally the thing has been gutted, a ragged gashcarved under its tail to midway up its chest, eyeslike stagnant water, horns intricate as a woodwind.Where did the viscera go? Where do the viscera ever go?I am in a car driving to the northernmost pointon this spit. Porte de Mort. Death’s Northern Door.Literally where my grandmother lives. Her 89-year-old cousinhas just fallen out a window but is all right, the bruiseslike stained glass. Enthusiasm. To be in God.My grandmother says it is proof, and I nod my headbecause I too would like to live in such a worldwhere an eighty-nine year old crawls out a windowand falls seven feet to the ground, in turn the miracleof her body stained a deep blue, vitreous. In one roomof the unfinished mansion where we will celebrate the day,the ninety-year-old matriarch sleeps in her four-poster bedunder the canopy of a wedding dress, its hundred eyeletsa fallacy. After dinner someone will hand around an indulgenceof the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, the lady’s dark cheekmarred as if she has been scratched. Who at this tablefled the police? Who left that place in flames, the rubbleof infinite hearths? The deer’s eyes like perfect cataracts,the evidence cooling. When I think of my room in the earth,I can’t breathe. A friend of a friend recently hit a small bearwith his car. At the end of my favorite novel a bearis dancing on a makeshift stage, the bear a grotesquerielike the rest of us. No one stopped to help,said my friend. Traffic barely slowed. I do not judge this,or even the surreptitious footage of the workerssomewhere on the killing floor, stompingthe breast-heavy creatures with their rubber boots.How we raise them not to fly, what should waftgnostically through the air, the hollowness of evolving.My heart is doing that thing again, saying climb the stairson your knees. I tell a friend a man halfway across the worldhas been killed, torn apart by motorbikes, each limbtied in a different direction. Could a universe be born this way?One minute you are scarping the silvery bark off a birchwhen it comes to you forever and there you liein the bed of a blood-smeared truck at a stoplighton Highway 41 because this is the season of messages.The man was a teacher. He taught girls.When they came for him he told his childrennot to cry. Then the men took out half his bowel,the viscera steaming as they do, and they tied himingeniously in such a way that they tore him apart.In that other place three million of us died. When I left,I left them all behind. In the unfinished mansionsomeone will ask me what I’m thankful for.What to say? That one of the most beautiful thingsI have ever seen was a paper nest secreted by wasps,and that in the summer I would sleep under it,the runnelled mass turning like a planet in the moonlight?I will admit I was in favor of war and now look what’s happened.At the end of the road the man driving the truck will eatthe deer. If I had to watch someone be torn apart by motorbikesI would still be me, which is the horror of it all.I am ten.My mother sits in a blackrocking chair in the parlorand tells stories of a country schoolsurrounded by ricefieldsand no roads.I stand in the kerosene lightbehind her,earning my allowance.A pennyfor each white hair I pull.The emotion of trucks, buses & troop trainsbrings them here,to the wrong side of another state.A woman at the Klamath Falls depotcalls it the wrong side of the ocean.Crumbs hide around the table legsin the mess hall,dishes & silverwareclink a strange song.Families talk across long tables.Questions drop like puzzlesto the unfinished floor.Blocks away from their new homea woman finds a latrinenot backed up. Standsin line, waiting her turnin the wind. Downthe center of the open room:12 toilet stools, six pair,back to back. Sits downand asks for privacy,holding a towel in front of herwith trembling hands.In a North Dakota prisoner-of-war camp,surrounded by Germans & Italians,a quiet manhammers a samurai sword from scrap metalat night in a boiler room.A secret edgeto hold against the dark mornings.He sends love notes to his pregnant wifein Tule Lakesewn in pantsmailed home for mending.His censored lettersmention a torn pocket.She finds the paper near the rip,folded & secret in the lining.White voicesclaim the other side of the oceanis so crowdedthe people want to find deathacross the phantom river.Headlines shake their nervous words.Out on the coastbeach birds print their calligraphyin the sand.It is such a small country.It is the picture of a man who dreamsat night, his dreams a cartoon colorhe can’t forget in his blue cell:a fork chases a hard-boiled eggacross the smooth paper,cheered on by an angry alarm clock.The clock ringsand the artist knows it is morningeven though the iron cellis in a basement with no windows.In the center of the paintingthe devil blows a whistleand his pitchfork drips blood.Above in the nighta man has taken off in a Buck Rogers spaceshipheading for a yellow one-eyed moon.He grips the steering wheel in the open cockpitand doesn’t look back.In a lower cornerunder a naked treea satyr sits and plays his pan-flute.The notes weave all around the painting,twist around a girldancing in veils.The man who dreams all thispulls at his covers,drowses at the bottom of the painting.The man who painted thisdied in his dreams.You have been smiling across the table at your datewith a sesame seed stuck in your teeth.You will gain sophistication, become accepted by Reader’s Digest, and retire in Puyallup.In your next life you will be a teacherand no one will ever call you by your first name.After your next vacation you will come homeand discover that your neighbors have redecoratedin the style of Iowa trailer court.If you feel like you’re getting old,secretly plant zucchini in your neighbor’s flowerbeds.Avoid people who iron their sheetsor roll their socks & underwear.Painting and poetry and music will show us where we shouldbe going, not the senate or tv news.The next thermos bottle you see will actuallybe a listening device made in Korea.All the people in this restaurantare glad that they are not you.The sky wants the water to turn grey,but if I notice how wavesplay with the clumps of yellow flags,or the way turtles share logs,or even try to understand a friend’s decisionto walk onto a glacierand end her life—I will be readyfor any poems that have been waiting. The horizon opens as I walk,escorted by swans and Canada geese.I need to stop backpedaling into the present.In my old life people would straightenthe truth, but the riverflows in curves.The names of my father and my motherrest next to each other in Greenwood Cemetery.The distance between me and the mountainsmeasures an uneven thought: I feel like an orphan.An early moon is just a piece of changein the softening sky.Light is such an actress. Time to seekHopper’s wish to simply paint sunlighton the wooden wall of a house. I am growingolder. Maru in Japanese meansthe shipwill make it back home.No, I am not deformed.I wear these socksBecause I haven't any gloves,And my fingers are bitten with frost.They feel like stumps.Luckily, I finished coveringThe citrus tree with sheets of burlap.Before darkness,I will light a smudge potNear the mummified trunk,Then anoint my hands in a blue salve.Yesterday was coldBut the freeze is on now.I must remind myselfNot to lick any cars.Mr. Nishizawa, a house over,Told me his nephewLost a fourth of his tongueFor that reason. Years ago,The rosebushes were ruined to a freezeAnd have never come back.If needed, I will stay up all nightAnd pray, will let the hoarfrostBurn in my chest. My grandfatherAte the yield from this treeAfter he died. I saw him.That boy, the champion breath holder,Kenji Takezo, lost his titleThis year to Mack StantonA retired truck driverNew to the area.Held in the town swimming poolThirty-five participants inhaledDeeply all at onceSubmerged the depth.The contest went on into twilight.One by one each personCame up sucking air.Kenji was the town favorite.We wanted him to win again.He trained so hard,It was the only real talentHe hadOther than surfing and makingTrouble. When he surfacedSecond to lastGulping the nightThen vomiting water,We were disappointed.He was doing so well.He had his lucky twenty-pound brickCradled in his lap.It kept him down.But that trucker Mack was too good.He readComic books, aloud, underwater.We watched from the bleachersHis laughter bursting above him.Kenji saw this too.He never had anybodyRead to himNot even his mother,And he wanted to hearWhat was being readWhat his opponent found so funny.After Kenji Takezo fell from a wave,The turbulence of whitewash confusedHis sense of direction.He breathed inWhen he should haveHeld tight. By accident, he swallowedThe Pacific. The water poured down his throat,A blue cascade he could not see.He felt in his stomachThe heavy life of the ocean.It wasn’t funny, but he giggledWhen a school of fish tickled his ribs.He went home, the surf not rideable,It was no longer there,The water weighted in his belly.That night, while he slept, the tide moved.The long arms of the moonReached inside him pulling the Pacific free.When he woke the next morning,He lay in a puddle of ocean that was his.Steel horses noddingIn the petroleum field are beastsThat suckThe crude of earth.They have lived here for as long as IRemember. This moment,I smell wild incense:Heather, abducted by a desert wind.Its growth hidesThe rain-carved ribs of the foothills.Evening swallowsThe city fasting on late fall.Years ago, after hearing the storyAbout a boy who lostBoth legs while playing on an oil pump,I was dared to straddle one.All my friends were there to watchThe Pacific behind me burning with dusk.The brute lifted me to the sky,Where I merged with the twilight,A warm breeze embracing my back.None of them noticedThe world stopped to breathe.When I looked, they disappeared.Nearby in pink-flowered bushesSomeone foundThe girl who’d been missing for weeks.They stood in awe, the bodyDecomposing, while I rodeThe slow bucking animal.Two months later, off the same pump,A man dove,An imperfect swan into night.He landed in the dirt gullyBreaking the soft, white wingsHe never had.Today, I catch in my handAn insect charged with lightning.It ticklesThe obscure scoop of my palmAs I hold it to my mouth and explainA wish so simpleBy morning I will have forgotten it.I releaseThe bug to a desert windThat is racing toward the sea,A brutal dryness in its wake.Fire in the hills everywhere.About the only thing I thought I knewwas that nothing I’d ever know would doany good. Sunrise, say, or that the partof the horse’s hoof that most resemblesa human palm is called the frog;certain chords on the guitar of no mercantile use;the abstruse circuitry of an envelopequatrain; even the meaning of horripilation.Sometimes on a flatland mound the ancients had made,I took heart in the pointlessness of starsand lay there until my teeth chattered.I earned my last Boy Scout merit badgebuilding a birdhouse out of license platesmanufactured by felons in the big house.No more paramilitary organizations for me,I said, ten years before I was drafted.I had skills. Sure-footedness and slickfielding. Eventually I would learn to unhooka bra one-handed, practicing on my friend,his sister's worn over his T-shirt (I tookmy turns too). One Easter Sunday I hidthrough the church service among the pipesof the organ and still did not have faith,although my ears rang until Monday.I began to know that little worth knowingwas knowable and faith was delusion.I began to believe I believed in believingnothing I was supposed to believe in,except the stars, which, like me,were not significant, except for their light,meaning I loved them for their pointlessness.I believed I owned them somehow.A C major 7th chord was beautiful and almost rare.The horse I loved foundered and had to beput down. The middle rhyme in an envelopequatrain was not imprisoned if it was right.In cold air a nipple horripilatesand rises, the sun comes up and up and up,a star that bakes the eggsin a Boy Scout license plate birdhouse.God was in music and music was God.A drill sergeant seized me by my dog tagchain and threatened to beat meto a pile of bloody guts for the peace signI’d chiseled in the first of my two tags,the one he said they’d leave in my mouthbefore they zipped the body bag closed.Yet one more thing I’d come to know.He also said that Uncle Sam owned my ass,no more true than my ownershipof the stars. I can play a C major 7th chordin five or six places on the neck of a guitar.A stabled horse’s frog degrades; a wild horse’sbecomes a callus, smooth as leather.Stars are invisible in rainy weather,something any fool knows, of course.The first space shuttle launch got delayed untilSunday, so we had to watch the shuttle’s returnto Earth in class instead—PS113’s paunchy black& white rolled in, the antennae on top adjustedsideways & down for better reception. That sameday, Garrett stole my new pencil box. That sameday, Cynthia peed her jeans instead of goingto the bathroom & letting Garrett steal her pencilbox. Both of us too upset to answer questions aboutspace flight, so we got sent to the back of the class.I smelled like the kind of shame that starts a fighton a Tuesday afternoon. Cynthia smelled like pee& everyday Jordache. The shuttle made its slick wayback to Earth, peeling clouds from the monochromaticsky & we all—even the astronomically marginal—were winners. American, because a few days before,a failed songwriter put a bullet in the presidentin the name of Jodie Foster. The shuttle lookedlike a bullet, only with wings & a cockpit, & whenit finally landed, the class broke into applause& the teacher snatched a thinning American flagfrom the corner, waved it back & forth in honorof our wounded president & those astronauts.blacks painted onto bricks & split vinyl on the East Side,jaws as tight as window locks with the curtains drawn& behind that diligent fabric: blacks already tuckedinto homemade forts—folding chairs, wobbly backbones& the whole, snowy world waiting outside like ghoststories whispered around the last sputtering match. & later,top sheets pulled up over heads from fear of mirrorsat midnight or some backfired beater’s rusty pop pop popafter the key twists at the edge of the week. No doubt:Tuesday is the scariest day in Section 8, but Friday is rightafter it in the suburbs. & after those trembling weekdays,even more blacks with money disappearing & reappearingas unexpectedly as poltergeists inside of TVs & hauntedtrees with fast fingers in West Side yards. & still nota wavelength of any kind for a black to put in the bank.The inks in everybody’s hatted & contracting checkbooksdon’t change black. Some front-row architecture might.Some guns, too, & their loud, colorful opportunities:whatever version of black is inside a fist around a grip.Not a color, really—more like the face a man makes inthe glinting face of a gun pointed at him every single day.This is the g-dropping vernacular     I am stuck in. This is the polyphonewhere my head is an agrarian gang     sign pointing like a percussion malletto a corn maze in one of the smaller     Indiana suburbs where there aren’tsupposed to be black folks. Be cool & try     to grin it off. Be cool & try to leanit off. Find a kind of black & bet on it.     I’m grinning to this vernacularlike the big drum laugh tracks a patriotic     marching band. Be cool & try to ridethe beat the same way me, Pryor,     & Ra did driving across the 30th StreetBridge, laughing at these two dudes     with big afros like it’s 1981 peeing intothe water & looking at the stars. Right     before Officer Friendly hit his lights.Face the car, fingers locked behind     your heads. Right after the fireworksstarted popping off. Do I need to call      the drug dog? Right after the rattlingwindows, mosquitoes as busy in my ears     as 4th of July traffic cops. Right beforethe thrill of real planets & pretend planets     spun high into the sky, Ra throwing upthree West Side fingers, each ringed     by pyrotechnic glory & the misnomerof the three of us grinning at the cop’s club     down swinging at almost the exact sametime Pryor says, Cops put a hurting on your     ass, man. & fireworks light up in the samecolors as angry knuckles if you don’t     duck on the double. Especially on the WestSide—more carnivorous than almost any     other part of Earth Voyager saw whenit snapped a blue picture on its way out     of this violently Technicolor heliosphere.Leaves scarcely breathingin the black breeze;the flickering swallowdraws circles in the dusk.In my lovingdying hearta twilight is coming,a last ray, gently reproaching.And over the evening forestthe bronze moon climbs to its place.Why has the music stopped?Why is there such silence?The clock-cricket singing,that’s the fever rustling.The dry stove hissing,that’s the fire in red silk.The teeth of mice millingthe thin supports of life,that’s the swallow my daughterwho unmoored my boat.Rain-mumble on the roof—that’s the fire in black silk.But even at the bottom of the seathe bird-cherry will hear ‘good-bye’.For death is innocent,and the heart,all through the nightingale-fever,however it turns, is still warm.Let us praise the twilight of freedom, brothers,the great year of twilight!A thick forest of nets has been let downinto the seething waters of night.O sun, judge, people, desolateare the years into which you are rising!                  Let us praise the momentous burdenthat the people’s leader assumes, in tears.Let us praise the twilight burden of power,its weight too great to be borne.Time, whoever has a heartwill hear your ship going down. We have roped swallows togetherinto legions.Now we can’t see the sun.Everywhere nature twitters as it moves.In the deepening twilight the earth swims into the netsand the sun can’t be seen.But what can we lose if we try onegroaning, wide, ungainly sweep of the rudder?The earth swims. Courage,brothers, as the cleft sea falls back from our plow.Even as we freeze in Lethe we’ll rememberthe ten heavens the earth cost us.Let me be in your servicelike the othersmumbling predictions,mouth dry with jealousy.Parched tonguethirsting, not even for the word—for me the dry air is emptyagain without you.I’m not jealous any morebut I want you.I carry myself like a victimto the hangman.I will not call youeither joy or love.All my own blood is gone.Something strange paces there now.Another momentand I will tell you:it's not joy but tortureyou give me.I'm drawn to youas to a crime—to your ragged mouth,to the soft bitten cherry.Come back to me,I'm frightened without you.Never had you such powerover me as now.Everything I desireappears to me.I'm not jealous any more.I'm calling you.Whoever kisses time’s ancient nodding headwill remember later, like a loving son,how the old man lay down to sleepin the drift of wheat outside the window.He who has opened the eyes of the age,two large sleepy apples with inflamed lids,hears forever after the roar of riversswollen with the wasted, lying times.The age is a despot with two sleepy applesto see with, and a splendid mouth of earth.When he dies he’ll sink onto the numbarm of his son, who’s already senile.I know the breath growing weaker by the dayNot long not till the simple songof the wrongs of earth is cut off,and a tin seal put on the lips.O life of earth! O dying age!I’m afraid no one will understand youbut the man with the helpless smileof one who has lost himself.O the pain of peeling back the raw eyelidsto look for a lost word, and with limeslaking in the veins, to huntfor night herbs for a tribe of strangers!The age. In the sick son’s blood the deposit of limeis hardening. Moscow’s sleeping like a wooden coffin.There’s no escaping the tyrant century.After all these years the snow still smells of apples.I want to run away from my own doorstep,but where? Out in the street it’s dark,and my conscience glitters ahead of melike salt strewn on the pavement.Somehow I’ve got myself set for a short journeythrough the back lanes, past thatched eaves, starling houses,an everyday passer-by, in a flimsy coat,forever trying to button the lap-robe.Street after street flashes past,the frozen runners crunch like apples;can’t get the button through the button-hole,it keeps slipping out of my fingers.The winter night thunderslike iron hardware through the Moscow streets.Knocks like a frozen fish, or billows in steam,flashing like a carp in a rosy tea-room.Moscow is Moscow again. I say hello to her.‘Don’t be stern with me; never mind.I still respect the brotherhoodof the deep frost, and the pike’s justice.’The pharmacy’s raspberry globe shines onto the snow.Somewhere an Underwood typewriter’s rattled.The sleigh-driver’s back, the snow knee-deep,what more do you want? They won't touch you, won’t kill you.Beautiful winter, and the goat skyhas crumbled into stars and is burning with milk.And the lap-robe flaps and ringslike horse-hair against the frozen runners.And the lanes smoked like kerosene stoves,swallowed snow, raspberry, ice,endlessly peeling, like a Soviet sonatina,recalling nineteen-twenty.The frost is smelling of apples again.Could I ever betray to gossip-mongersthe great vow to the Fourth Estateand oaths solemn enough for tears?Who else will you kill? Who else will you worship?What other lie will you dream up?There’s the Underwood’s cartilage. Hurry, rip out a key,you’ll find a little bone of a pike.And in the sick son’s blood the deposit of limewill melt, and there’ll be sudden blessèd laughter.But the simple sonatina of typewritersis only a faint shade of those great sonatas.Our lives no longer feel ground under them.At ten paces you can’t hear our words.But whenever there’s a snatch of talkit turns to the Kremlin mountaineer,the ten thick worms his fingers,his words like measures of weight,the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip,the glitter of his boot-rims.Ringed with a scum of chicken-necked bosseshe toys with the tributes of half-men.One whistles, another meouws, a third snivels.He pokes out his finger and he alone goes boom.He forges decrees in a line like horseshoes,One for the groin, one the forehead, temple, eye.He rolls the executions on his tongue like berries.He wishes he could hug them like big friends from home.Many months have passedsince the diagnosis,and you’re still grieving for her.She’s not dead yet.But she’s lost, like a child is lost—her mind the ocean floor,where she kicks up sandand churns in the water.Al, we call it, or AD—never by its real nameas if mentioning the word would bring bad luck—the need to cross one’s self across the heart,throw back to the ocean half of one’s catch,turn three times and pray to the East.Papa’s and her letters,written during their courtship,are tied with a faded, red ribbonand sunk in a safe deposit box at Bishop Trust.Long ago, she gave them to youfor safekeeping. At the timeshe exacted a promise from you,that you would not read themuntil she was dead.We twist down the spiral staircasecurled like a strand of seaweedinto the cold room of vaults,the heavy thud of door distinct as your sadnessfollowing us everywhere. There,you turn over the bundle of lettersin your hand like unbelievable money.“I’m so tempted to read them,” you say.You want her back,the feisty and independent one,the one who could, at eighty,do ten knee bends in aerobics class,dance a smooth jitterbugand shuttle like the tideto and from the house about her business.Not this Elizabeth you mourn,the one who can no longer reason,who points and giggles at fat peopleand smells, sometimes, like the ocean.Time slides like Dali’s clock.Elizabeth is surprisedthat she once was married and had a husband,that she once gave birth to sons.In her illnessElizabeth believes we do this deliberately,the washing of her body.She blames me,her Japanese daughter-in-lawfor having made keeping her clean a fetish.Angry, she says we do this to tormenther soul, the shower a hotspray of needles we subjecton her moon-colored skin.She hates it even moreif I’m there to wash her.She wants her son,the person she thinks of these daysas her lover, or husband, or father.Memory and privacy,she cries at their lossas I soap her down like an old car.What protestations!And as I listen to her,I think of these bodieswe have given so freely to men,yet feel ashamed ofwhen in the eyes of another woman.How she fawnswhen she thinks a man’s around.Today, she bangs the walls.“I hate you! The water’s too wet!”Hanging onto the safety bars,she pitches back and forthlike a child,wanting to be let out at the gate.I wash her back.She spins aroundin my soap-lathered hands,and loosening her face in mine,she glares.She sticks out her tongue,and biting down on it, she squeals,jowls swinging, arms jiggling.Then, in a dive of both handsbetween her legs,she drops to a semi-squat, simian postureand thrusts her pelvis bones forwardlike mountains in an antediluvian upheaval.In a gesture of obscenity,she unfolds her petalsand displays her withered sex to me—the same way boys moon, flip the birdor grab their crotch and waggle their tongues—the profane she feels but can’t articulate.When I was three,a tsunami hit town.“Daddy, Daddy, save me,don’t let me drown.”He saved meand my common-type dolls.When I was sixteen,another tsunami hit town.I cried to my daddy,“Daddy, Daddy, please save me,don’t let me drown!”But he let go of my hand!I still danceto what broke on my life.My son lives on the streets.We don’t see each other much.Like a mother who puts white lilieson the headstone of a dead child,I put money into his bank account,clothes into E-Z Access storageand pretend he’s far away—at a boarding school, or in a foreign country.Nights, I dream fairy tales about him.I dream he becomes a prince,scholar or warrior who rescues mefrom sorrow, the way he rescued mewhen he was a child and said,“Mommy, don’t cry,” and brought teainto the room of his father’s acrimony—brave, standing tall in the forestfire of his father’s scorn. I waketo the empty sound of wind in the trees.He says he wants to live with me.I say I can’t live with him—boy whose words crash like branches in a rain storm.Nothing can hold him in,the walls of a house too thin.Back home, I had seenthe “study-hard-so-you-don’t-become-like-them”street bums on Mamo Street,and he’s like them.These days, in order to catch a glimpse of him,I circle the city. One day,I see him on his bike.People give him wide berth,the same way birds avoid power lines,oncoming cars or trees.I park on a side street.Wild-eyed, he flies the blockas if in a holding pattern.Not of my body, not of my hopes,he homes in on what can’t be given or taken away.In college, people were always breaking up.We broke up in parking lots,beside fountains.Two people broke upacross a table from meat the library.I could not sit at that table againthough I did not know them.I studied bees, who were ableto convey messages through dancingand could find their wayshome to their hiveseven if someone put up a blockade of sheetsand boards and wire.Bees had radar in their wings and brainsthat humans could barely understand.I wrote a paper proclaimingtheir brilliance and superiorityand revised it at a small caféfeaturing wooden hive-shaped honey-dippersin silver honeypotsat every table.From the remainsof his cremation,the monks recoveredthe seat of Thich Quang Duc’sconsciousness —a bloodless protestto awaken the heartof the oppressorofferedat the crossing ofPhanh Dinh Phung& Le Van Duyetdoused in gasoline &immolated by 4-meterflames the orange-robedarhat folded inthe stillnessof full lotushis body witheringhis crown blackeninghis flesh charringhis corpse collapsinghis heart refusing to burnhis heart refusing to burnhis heart refusing to burnin the shooter’sface, she recognizesher sibling’s coarseunforgiving hair,his yellow skin,& vacant stare,the year her brotherbroke down, she wasstill in highschool, seventeen —w/ a taste for cuttingnot class but hands& arms any outletto escapethis “community”denies illness,a family reacts —against crying out loudlet it be some other Asianin the shooter’sface, I recognizemy sibling’s coarseunforgiving hair,his yellow skin,& vacant stare,the year my brotherbroke down, I wasstill in highschool, seventeen —w/ a taste for cuttingnot class but hands& arms any outletto escapethis “community”denies illness,a family reacts —against crying out loudlet it be some other AsianAt Pearl Street station,two brown-skinned menin painter’s pants standout in a sea of whiteI am just one more facesticking out in a crowd& it is my privilegethat prevents me fromunderstanding whythe workers want to knowhow to buy one-way tripsthe automated machinesells only one roundtrip fee,back to where you came fromhe isn’t asking me for changesays it clear enough so thatthere can be no mistakeSí.

I sometimes wonder ifperception is the same; if the quantity of percepts, or our trove of eideticthings, is not limitless but rather constant: the measure, say, of a sunlitfield. So if we dip like deep-sea divers to the world, we’ll have to use apurse-seine to sieve our sense impressions. We’re hoarding the imageat our peril.

I think of sacrificeas nourishment, the light feeding bark and veinsand blood and skin, the tree better offfor wanting nothing more. I used to imaginethe chakra like this—a hole in the soulfrom the top of the head, where the light of knowingcan shimmer through. In the summer of 1979I saw that light shoot from my brother’s foreheadas we sat chanting in a temple in Manila.He didn’t see it pulsing like a bulb in a storm,but he said he felt the warmth that wasn’t warmthbut peace. And I, who have never beenso privileged, since then have wonderedif we believed everything because not to believewas to be unhappy. I’ve seen that light elsewhere—on a river in Bangkok, or pixeled acrossthe shattered façades of Prague—but it is herewhere I perceive its keenest rarity, where I knowit has passed over all the world, has given shapeto cities, cast glamour over the eyes of the skeptic,so that it comes to me informed with the wonderof many beings. I can’t begin to say how infinite I feel,as though I were one of many a weightless absencetouches, and out of this a strange transformation:the soul ringed with changes, as old as a tree,as old as light. I am always learning the same thing:there is no other way to live than this,still, and grateful, and full of longing. The dry basin of the moon must have heldthe bones of a race, radiant minerals,or something devoid of genesis, angel-heavy,idea-pure. All summer we had waited for it,our faces off-blue in front of the TV screen.Nothing could be more ordinary—two figuresdigging dirt in outer space—while mother repeatedNeil Armstrong’s words, like a prayerelectronically conveyed. The dunes were litlike ancient silk, like clandestine pearl.In the constant lunar night this luminescencewas all we hoped for. A creature unto itself,it poured into the room like a gradual floodof lightning, touching every object with the cool burnof something not quite on fire. If we stepped outManila would be blank ether, way station,a breathless abeyance. It didn’t matter,at that moment, where our lives would lead:father would disown one brother,one sister was going to die. Not yet unhappy,we were ready to walk on the moon. Recklessin our need for the possible, we knewthere was no turning back, our bags already packed,the future a religion we could believe in.It takes just two people to bring the worldto ruin. So goes the history of love.At the end of the day we tally the casualtiesof war, victory for the one who gets woundedthe least. You say it’s time for a changebut I don’t know to what end, change beingjust the skin of some incandescent creaturewhose grotesque beauty is what we adore,whom some people call love, whom wevenerate because it consumes us, slim pickingsfor its huge soul. My people say, don’t lookor you’ll go blind. You say the end was alwaysjust around the bend. I say all we haveis unconditional surrender to the future.So unreliable is the past that I feel compelledto leave unmourned the blind, relentless lovesthat may have scorched into our heartsthe way the saints accepted stigmata. My people say,look back or lose your way. Or, walk backwards,if you can. So I found myself on a bus to New York Cityto lose myself completely. Past Hunters Pointwe hit the factory of souls—a thousand tombstonesfrom which a silk-like canopy of smoke rose to meetGod knows what—a spacious emptiness, the end.I’ve heard the world’s never going to end.I’ve heard it will go on and on, and we will beas nebulous as Nebuchadnezzar, our livenot worth a footnote, our grandest schemesno more than feeble whispers, all memoryshifting like the continental plates. In the future,all science will finally come around; geneticengineering, I’ve been told, will be all the rage,and we will be a super race in a worldinfallibly perfected, where trains run on time,love never dies, and hope can be purchasedby the pound. It’s called immortalization of the cell lines. We will choose what will survive.Our destiny made lucid, we will find the worldcontemplating itself, like the young Narcissus,one hand about to touch the pool, his bodylurched towards that marvelous reflection.I suppose we’ve always felt compelledto desensitize our failures. My people say,to go unnoticed, you play dead. I myselfmay have chosen to forget a face, a name,some cruel word uttered carelessly, but not,after all the harm is done, intending any pain.And many others may have chosen to forget me.It works both ways. My people say, nasa huliang pagsisi: regret is the final emotion.It’s what you see when you look back.It’s what’s no longer there.You are running away from everyonewho loves you,from your family,from old lovers, from friends.They run after you with accumulationsof a former life, copper earrings,plates of noodles, bannersof many lost revolutions.You love to say the trees are naked nowbecause it never happensin your country. This is a mysteryfrom which you will neverrecover. And yes, the trees are naked now,everything that still breathes in themlies silent and starkand waiting. You love October mostof all, how there is no wordfor so much splendor.This, too, is a sourceof consolation. Between you and memoryeverything is water. Names of the dead,or saints, or history.There is a realm in which—no, forget it,it’s still too early to make anyone understand.A man drives a stakethrough his own heartand afterwards the opposite of nostalgiabegins to make sense: he stops raking the leavesand the leaves take overand again he has learnedto let go.If there is a god, let it be the hyenawho plunges her mouth into the river after eatingour grandfather’s poisoned bait, who,dark with thirst, poisons the riverunbeknownst to both of them.Her ghosts stand in the street where we are calledalready through “time” out of our houses. She tellsher stories. We tell her ours. We all clean our teethwith what is sharp. She asks, Will you add this story to your stories of history & land & peace?Yes, we will add this story. We ask her,Will you add these poems to your repertoire of songsabout hunger & thirst & fur? & she, being wiser than we,says, Yes, I will sing them ifyou grant me your permissionto turn them into poems abouta mercy.Please raise your hand,whomever else of youhas been a child,lost, in a marketor a mall, withoutknowing it at first, followinga stranger, accidentallythinking he is yours,your family or parent, evengrabbing for his hands,even calling the wordyou said then for “Father,”only to see the facelook strangely down, utterlyforeign, utterly not the onewho loves you, youwho are a bird suddenlystunned by the glass partitionsof rooms.How farthe world you knew, & tall,& filled, finally, with strangers.    Body of space. Body of dark.                    Body of light.The Skyview apartments                    circa 1973, a boy iskneeling on the rooftop, a boy who                     (it is importantto mention here his skin                    is brown) prepares his telescope,the weights & rods,                    to better see the moon.

Inside my own bodyas I write this poem my body                    is making a boy even as the radiocalls out the Missouri coroner’s news,                    the Ohio coroner’s news.2015. My boy will nod                    for his milk & close his mouth aroundthe black eye of my nipple.                    We will survive. How did it happen?The boy. The cops. My body in this poem.                    My milk pulling down into droplets of lightas the baby drinks & drinks them down                    into the body that is his own, see it,splayed & sighing as a star in my arms. Maybe he will be the boy who studies stars.Maybe he will be (say it)                    the boy on the coroner’s tablesplayed & spangled                    by an officer’s lead as if he, too, weren’t madeof a trillion glorious cells & sentences. Trying to last.  Leadless, remember? The body’s beginning,splendored with breaths, turned,by time, into, at least, this song. This moment-made & the mackerel-“soul”caught flashing inside the brief moment of the body’s net,then, whoosh, back into the sea of space. The poem dreams of bodies always leadless, bearingonly things ordinaryas water & light.I adore you: you’re a harrowing event.I like you very ugly, condensed to onedeep green pang. You cannot ask the simplestquestion, your hold is all clutch and sinker.Cannibal old me,with my heart up my throat, blasting on all sideswith my hundred red states. Hidden little striver.How not to know it, the waist-deep trance of you,the cursing, coursing say of you. Embarrassing today.                                                  Curiouser and curiouser,your body is a mouth, is a night of travel, your bodyis tripling the sideways insouciance. The musclein you knows gorgeous, in you knows tornadoes.In an instant’s compass, your blood flees you like a cry.                                                  You put on my heat,(that’s the way you work) I’m a bandit grippinghard on the steal. The substitutions come swiftly,hungering down the valley, no one question to coverall of living. I arrange myself in the order of my use.                                                  You’re wrong and rightat the same time, a breathless deluxe and a devouringchopping down the back door. You slap my attentionall over the dark. What’s in me like a chime?Sometimes, sometimes, I come to you for the surprise.Taking on an aspect of the Orient,Skies full of hatchets and orangesLove, uninvited, hangs in the blood:But what is a kingdom to a dying emperor?Skies full of hatchets and orangesKeep the birds singing, sorrows fresh—But what is a kingdom to a dying emperor,As the nights grow steadily into mountains.Keep the birds singing, sorrows fresh—The princess braids these into a necklaceAs the nights grow steadily into mountains,Why, even regrets recede unexpectedly.The princess braids these into a necklace:Roads and rivers that lead away from the palace.Why, even regrets recede unexpectedlyIn a solitude full of wars and songs.Roads and rivers that lead away from the palaceNever converge in that vast landscape;In a solitude full of wars and songs,The words remain light and fugitive.Never converge in that vast landscapeIn the way that stars keep their distance.The words remain light and fugitiveIn an anticipation crossed with absence.In the way that stars keep their distance,Love, uninvited, hangs in the bloodIn an anticipation crossed with absence,Taking on an aspect of the Orient.We stopped to watch the accident.Fire! It had finally come to pass.Just as surely as I was a cowardcarrying a wolf. It stepped out from me,it was paradise leaving me, running towardsthe giant idea of that melting house.So often you don’t think,“Little nicks of monstrosity, I shall be splendid in it.”Be large with those small fears. The whole skyhas fallen on you and all you can do about it isshout, dragging your fear-ettes by their pinked ears.They dance a number now: consequence withoutsequence. Lovingly broadminded in theirrealization and ruin, expert at the parting shot.Not so small after all, we micro tomacro, swelling to the horror showslifted from the sly ways of life.You, both scorched and shining in the terrorof the equivocal moment, its box of cheekylogics rattling cold certainties out of boundsand into the plaits of a girl’s desirous ends.A little debauched, the flirt in a freckling,wondering spun to falling comes to thispert contract of a paradox: saying thingsbecause they will do no good, ringing changein frumpy mono-determination, fruity and fruitless.Exploded out of shelter, the tides come roaring in.Let in the hoarse Cassandras and the dull pain of thestoryteller. You’ve needed those eyes all along.We thought them disconcerting at first,but it’s the only way. You live here nowhaving exchanged etiquette for energy.Don’t be clever, don’t be shy! Participate today.Yesterday you say everything for their own sake,and soon enough, tomorrow, you learn a lot from them.On the morning of the 20th National Daymy uncle came home and told us:“All our troops have got into position,for the Russians may throw an atom-bomb on us today.”After breakfast he returned to the headquarters,but I had to go to school and join the celebration.The fear oppressed my back like a bag of sand.I could not raise the little triangle flag in my hand,nor could I shout slogans with my classmates.During the break I called together my best friendsand told them what would occur on this day.Benli said, “I must go homeand tell my dad to kill all our chickens.”Qingping said, “I must tell my auntnot to buy a sewing machine.Who would care about clothes if that happens.”Yimin and I said nothing,but we knew what we were going to do.We decided to go to the army,for we did not want to be roasted at homelike little pigs.The sound of a guitar drifts through the air.Cupped in my hand, a snowflake quivers lightly.Thick patches of fog draw back to revealA mountain range, rolling like a melody.I have gathered the inheritance of the four seasons.There is no sign of man in the valley.Picked wild flowers continue to grow,Their flowering is their time of death.Along the path in the primordial woodGreen sunlight flows through the slits.A russet hawk interprets into bird criesThe mountain's tale of terror.Abruptly I cry out,"Hello, Bai—hua—Mountain.""Hello, my—child," comes the echoFrom a distant waterfall.It was a wind within a wind, drawingA restless response from the land,I whispered, and the snowflakeDrifted from my hand down the abyss.for Yu LuokePerhaps the final hour is comeI have left no testamentOnly a pen, for my motherI am no heroIn an age without heroesI just want to be a manThe still horizonDivides the ranks of the living and the deadI can only choose the skyI will not kneel on the groundAllowing the executioners to look tallThe better to obstruct the wind of freedomFrom star-like bullet holes shall flowA blood-red dawnin the end, cold crows piece togetherthe night: a black mapI've come home—the way backlonger than the wrong roadlong as a lifebring the heart of winterwhen spring water and horse pillsbecome the words of nightwhen memory barksa rainbow haunts the black marketmy father's life-spark small as a peaI am his echoturning the corner of encountersa former lover hides in a windswirling with lettersBeijing, let metoast your lamplightslet my white hair leadthe way through the black mapas though a storm were taking you to flyI wait in line until the small windowshuts: O the bright moonI go home—reunionsare one lessfewer than goodbyesThe best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact.My mother took my heart out. She banked it on top of her stove.It glowed white. She put it back in my chest.Tita knew that overseas workers often had affairs.He licked me and I pretended it pinged through my body like a swift ideaThat I wrote about and considered like a bell of good craftsmanship.He also knew that their kids ate betterHe said your belly is like a cat’s.He said with his bowl up to his chinMore please.At night the fireflies come out. They flock to my window.I put my hands up against the screen.I think how fragile it is to be inside a house.They say I want permissionI paint my face. I say—just take it.Easy. If equally matched, we can offer battle.If unequal in any way, we can flee from him.Deprived of their father while sustained by his wages.I thought a lot about walking around at night.By myself. Just to think. But I never did.I thought I could just flick a switch.When I was born, my mother and father gave me a gardenia like personal star.Don’t you hate it when someone apologizes all the time?It’s like they are not even sorry.She brightens at the evidence. Like a strong appliance.You can make it hot.Grown ass people having tantrums.I’m unbought, unheated. Like a perfectly square morsel of lasagna.A wrathful rubics cube.To realize, I wish to ridicule people interested in martial arts.That I’m not getting better.My uncle would prank call my father, “Immigration!”He’d crow. And my father would fall to silence.No matter the heavy accent.No matter the voice he’d known unto boredom.One wing swigging out to its brother on the other bird.I measured this silence when I was a girl.The quality of the joke and how it restedon the bad stomach of a tensile citizenry.The joke was that, in an instant,We Lost Everything.It is important to remember who would laugh first—the perpetrator/uncle/jokester or the assailed/father/feather.Or maybe, it isn’t.Maybe what you should know is thatthey told this joke over and over and ever.My uncle crowed. My father disbelieved. We lost everything.And then, the svelte, sweet brier laughter.My father called me a chinkso I’d know how to receive it.So I wouldn’t be surprised.Therefore the good soldier will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his decision.In the wall, I bricked up my secret.So it would gush forth. I did this for effect.So you would know me.On the day of battle your soldiers might weep bedewing their garments.But it grew like a bullet loving its flowerstain.It happened nonetheless.But let them at once be brought to bay.Because you are simply my medic watching me.I’m a poem someone else wrote for me.All of the characters “beautiful and flawed.”When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far.My sister said, you can forget our way of life?I said yes and was annoyed. She ran away and I was desperate for her.I was screaming into the mindspeaker.When far away, we must make him believe we are near.I said, Christine, christine, christine.All birds—even those that do not fly—have wingsA constant confessionAdmission of omissionThis is your punctuated equilibriumAnd everything in betweenSlow it downThe moment of extinctionThe death of the last individual of a species(Let’s put it aside for now)Stay with itThis is our gene flowHow do you like our genetic driftA riff, a rift, a raft…Too rough for the second halfTake us under, take us downhillPaint pangenesis all over your dancing bodyThe new party godKeep the beat going, don’t stop, you can’t stopCrick & WatsonEvo-devoThis is your mother’s local phenomenonIf this is racial hygieneWhy do I feel so dirty?Microcosmic soulIt’s an involutionary wonderlandThis living matterA modern synthesis4.6 billion years of biologyCan’t stop the ideologyGraduate from meet/mateTo fitness landscape of sexual selectionFrom land over seaIt’s a hard lyricThe impression of a key in a bar of soapA transitional fossilKeep campingPlant the flagBury the burial moundPut the pop in popularAnd the sigh in scienceSome(where a) woman wearsthe face once given.
